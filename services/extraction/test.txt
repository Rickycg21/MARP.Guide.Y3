(Provisional) Nothing fancy but just in case here's a couple commands to manually test extraction. Should have the pdf you want to extract in the pdfs folder. Extracted text should get stored inside the text folder on a jsonl file. text_metadata.jsonl and and counters.json should also get updated

1) Set up the Docker
docker compose up -d --build rabbitmq extraction

2) Health Checks
curl -s http://localhost:5002/health
curl -s http://localhost:5002/metrics

4) Manual trigger
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5002/extract/name_of_pdf_you_want_to_extract

5) Reset counters
echo '{"events_consumed":0,"docs_extracted":0,"errors":0}' > ./data/metrics/counters.json
curl -s http://localhost:5002/metrics
